context = 'Sunset Motors was founded in 1998 in the city of Albany, New York, as a family-owned business. In its early years, the company specialized solely in selling pre-owned vehicles, but by 2005, it had expanded into the official sale of brand-new cars as well. Sunset Motors primarily serves customers living in the city and surrounding areas. The company offers a wide range of gasoline, diesel, and electric-powered vehicles. In 2015, Sunset Motors opened a dedicated service center for electric vehicles, providing battery replacement, energy efficiency inspections, and software updates. The company sells over 1,500 cars annually. Customer satisfaction is one of its top priorities, and it regularly conducts feedback surveys to improve service quality. In 2018, Sunset Motors received the ‚ÄúGreen Mobility Award‚Äù for its contributions to eco-friendly transportation. Over the years, it has partnered with several major car manufacturers, allowing it to offer competitive prices and exclusive models. The company‚Äôs showroom spans over 20,000 square feet and includes an interactive display area where customers can explore vehicle features. In 2020, Sunset Motors launched an online sales platform, enabling customers to browse inventory, request financing, and schedule test drives remotely. The service center operates six days a week and employs certified mechanics trained in the latest automotive technologies. Sunset Motors also provides free maintenance for the first year on all new car purchases. Its electric vehicle department has grown significantly, with over 40% of sales now coming from eco-friendly models. The company participates in community events, including local charity drives and environmental awareness campaigns. Sunset Motors offers a trade-in program, giving customers the option to exchange their old cars for credit toward a new purchase. Financing options are available with flexible payment plans, making car ownership accessible to a wider audience. The company works closely with banks and credit unions to secure favorable loan terms. For customers who want luxury, Sunset Motors stocks premium brands with advanced safety features. The dealership‚Äôs website features virtual 360-degree tours of vehicles, allowing buyers to explore interiors and exteriors in detail. A dedicated customer service hotline is available for inquiries, repairs, and complaints. Sunset Motors also maintains a large inventory of spare parts to ensure timely repairs. Its marketing campaigns emphasize reliability, affordability, and sustainability. Over the past five years, the company has expanded its workforce, employing over 120 people. The management team attributes the company‚Äôs growth to innovation, transparency, and a customer-first approach.
